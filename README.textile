Glyph is a _Rapid Document Authoring Framework_. 

Think of it like a sort of "Ruby On Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org but for creating text documents instead of web sites. With Glyph, you can manage your documents tidily in _projects_ that can be used to generate deliverables in different formats such as HTML or PDF (through "Prince":http://www.princexml.com).

h3. Main Features

Glyph uses a simple macro system to perform a wide variety of advanced tasks:
* Generate block-level HTML tags not commonly managed by lightweight markups, like @head@, @body@, @div@ and @table@.
* Create and validate internal and external links.
* Include and validate images and figures.
* Automatically determine header levels based on the document structure.
* Automatically generate a Table of Contents based on the document structure.
* Store common snippets of text in a single YAML file and use them anywhere in your document, as many times as you need.
* Store configuration settings in a YAML file and use them anywhere in your document, as many times as you need.
* Evaluate Ruby code within your document.
* Call macros from other macros (including snippets), carefully avoiding mutual calls.
* Include text files in other text files.
* Include the contents of configuration settings (author, title) in the document.
* Filter input explicitly or implicitly, based on file extensions when including files. 
* Manage comments and todo items.

h3. Installation

@gem install glyph@ -- simple, as always.

h3. Essential Glyph Commands

Glyph is 100% command line. Its interface "Git's":http://git-scm.com/ for its simplicity and power (thanks to the "Gli":http://github.com/davetron5000/gli gem). Here are some example commands: 

* @glyph init@ -- to initialize a new Glyph project in the current (empty) directory.
* @glyph add introduction.textile@ -- to create a new file called _introduction.textile_.
* @glyph compile@ -- to compile the current document into a single HTML file.
* @glyph compile -f pdf@ -- to compile the current document into HTML and then transform it into PDF using "Prince":http://www.princexml.com.
