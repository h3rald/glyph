	p[If you plan on extending Glyph, knowing how it works inside helps. It is not mandatory by any means, but it definitely helps, especially when creating complex macros.]
	p[What happens behind the scenes when you call code[glyph compile]? Glyph's code is parsed, analyzed and then translated into text, and here's how:]
	figure[document_generation.png|A sequence diagram for document generation]
	txt[From the diagram, it is possible to divide the document generation process into three phases:
* The _Parsing Phase_ starts when a chunk of Glyph code is passed (by the code[generate:document] Rake task, for example) to a class[Glyph::Interpreter]. The interpreter initializes a class[Glyph::Parser] that parses the code and returns an _Abstract Syntax Tree_ (AST) of class[Glyph::SyntaxNode] objects.
* The _Analysis Phase_ (Processing) starts when the interpreter method calls the @analyze@ method, instantiating a new class[Glyph::Document]. The @Glyph::Document@ object evaluates the AST expanding all macro nodesth (that's when macros are executed) and generates string.
* The _Finalization Phase_ (Post-Processing) starts when the interpreter calls the @finalyze@ method, causing the @Glyph::Document@ object to perform a series of finalizations on the string obtained after analysis, i.e. it replaces escape sequences and placeholders.

		@title[Example: A short note]
		p[As an example, consider the following Glyph code:]
		highlight[=html|
fmi[something\|#test]
...
section[
  @title[Test Section]
  @id[test]
...
]
		=]
		p[This simple snippet uses the %>[fmi] to link to a section later on in the document. When parsed, the produced AST is the following:]
		highlight[=ruby|
{:name=>:"--"}
  {:name=>:fmi, :escape=>false}
    {:name=>:"0"}
      {:value=>"something"}
    {:name=>:"1"}
      {:value=>"#test"}
  {:value=>"\\n"}
  {:value=>"\\\\[", :escaped=>true}
  {:value=>"..."}
  {:value=>"\\\\]", :escaped=>true}
  {:value=>"\\n"}
  {:name=>:section, :escape=>false}
    {:name=>:"0"}
      {:value=>"\\n\\t"}
      {:value=>"\\n\\t"}
      {:value=>"\\n"}
      {:value=>"\\\\[", :escaped=>true}
      {:value=>"..."}
      {:value=>"\\\\]", :escaped=>true}
      {:value=>"\\\n"}
    {:name=>:title, :escape=>false}
      {:value=>"Test Section"}
    {:name=>:id, :escape=>false}
      {:value=>"test"}
		=]
		p[This output is produced by calling the code[inspect] method on the AST. Each class[Glyph::SyntaxNode] object in the tree is basically an ordinary Glyph Hash with a parent and 0 or more chidren, so the code snippets above shows how the syntax nodes are nested.]
		p[The AST contains information about macro, parameter and attribute names, and escaping, and raw text values (the nodes without a code[:name] key), but nothing more.]
		p[When the AST is analyzed, the resulting textual output is the following:]
		highlight[=html|
<span class="fmi">for more information on something, see ‡‡‡‡‡PLACEHOLDER ¤ 1‡‡‡‡‡
</span>
\\\\\.[...\\\\\.]
<div class="section">
<h2 id="test">Test Section</h2>
\\\\\.[...\\\\\.]

</div>
		=]
		p[This looks almost perfect, except that:]
		ul[
			li[There's a nasty placeholder instead of a link: this is due to the fact that when the link is processed, there is no code[#text] anchor in the document, but there may be one afterwards (and there will be).]
			li[There are some escaped brackets.]
		]
		p[Finally, when the document is finalized, placeholders and escape sequences are removed and the final result is the following:]
		highlight[=html|
<span class="fmi">for more information on something, see <a href="#test">Test Section</a></span>
[...]
<div class="section">
<h2 id="test">Test Section</h2>
[...]

</div>
