By default, a Glyph project can be "compiled" into an HTML document. Additionally, Glyph can also be used to produce documents in the following formats:
* HTML5
* PDF (generated from HTML using a third-party generator like &[prince] or &[wkhtml])
* Web (i.e. multiple HTML files)
* Web5 (i.e. multiple HTML5 files)

section[
	@title[HTML/HTML5 output]
	p[To compile a Glyph project to an HTML document, use the #>[compile] within your Glyph project folder. Glyph parses the code[document.glyph] file (and all included files and snippets); if no errors are found, Glyph creates an HTML document in the code[/output/html] folder.] 
	p[The name of the HTML file can be set in the configuration (\.$>[document.filename]).]
	p[To create an HTML5 file instead, you must specify it explicitly like this:]
	p[code[= glyph compile -f html5 =]]
]
section[
	@title[PDF Output]
	p[To generate a PDF document, you must specify code[pdf] as format, like this:]
	p[code[= glyph compile -f pdf =]]
	p[The command above will attempt to compile the project into an HTML document and then call a third-party PDF generator to convert it into a PDF file.]

Currently, Glyph supports:
* &[prince] (version 7.0 or higher) -- a commercial generator that can be used freely for personal use. Prince produces high-quality PDF files and implement most of the new features introduced in CSS3, used heavily in Glyph's =>[#default_stylesheets|code[pagination.css]] default stylesheet.
* &[wkhtml] (version 1.0 beta4 or higher) -- an open source generator that uses the WebKit rendering engine to transform HTML files into PDF. Although not as advanced as Prince, it produces very satisfactory results.

By default, Glyph attempts to use wkhtmltopdf. To change this, set the $>[s_output_pdf_generator] to code[prince].

	note[Glyph expects PDF generators to be installed on the local machine and callable via command line using the code[wkhtmltopdf] or the code[prince] commands. Just install them as you would with any other program, depending on your operating system (yes, they both offer Windows installers).]

To generate a Web or Web5 output, specify @web@ or @web5@ as format. These two output formats behave different way from the others, and require that your project uses =>[#topics|topics] and layouts. 

![link to layout section goes here]
Basically, here's what happens when you compile your project in web or web5 format:
# The document code is parsed as normal
# Separate topic files are generated according to the code[@src] attributes of your sections
# The code[document.glyph] (or whatever file you're using as document source) is _not_ rendered. Instead, an @index.html@ file will be created in the output folder based on the contents of your @index@ layout.

	txt[You can also call the #>[compile] with a @--auto@ switch. If you do so, your project will be recompiled automatically every time any source file is changed.]
	note[Auto regeneration requires the =>[http://rubygems.org/gems/directory_watcher|directory_watcher] gem to be installed.]
