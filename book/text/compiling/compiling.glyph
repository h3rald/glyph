	p[By default, a Glyph project can be "compiled" into an HTML document. Additionally, Glyph can also be used to produce PDF documents through &[prince], and in future releases more output targets will be supported.]
	section[
		@title[HTML output]
		p[To compile a Glyph project to an HTML document, use the #>[compile] within your Glyph project folder. Glyph parses the code[document.glyph] file (and all included files and snippets); if no errors are found, Glyph creates an HTML document in the code[/output/html] folder.] 
		p[The name of the HTML file can be set in the configuration (\.$>[document.filename]).]

	section[
		@title[PDF Output]
		p[To generate a PDF document, you must specify code[pdf] as format, like this:]
		p[code[= glyph compile -f pdf =]]
		p[The command above will attempt to compile the project into an HTML document and then call Prince to generate a PDF document from it. In order for this to work, you must download and install &[prince]. It's not open source, but the free version is fully functional, and it just adds a small logo on the first page.]
		note[Glyph v\.%[Glyph::VERSION] has been successfully tested with Prince v7.0, and the PDF version of this very book was generated with it.]

		@title[Auto Regeneration]
		@id[auto_regeneration]
		txt[You can also call the #>[compile] with a @--auto@ switch. If you do so, your project will be recompiled automatically every time any source file is changed.]
		note[Auto regeneration requires the =>[http://rubygems.org/gems/directory_watcher|directory_watcher] gem to be installed.]
