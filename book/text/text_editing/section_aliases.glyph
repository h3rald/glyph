There are _a lot_ of macros that can be used in the same way as @section@, one for each element commonly used in =>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design|book design]. Each one of them is a simple wrapper for a @<div>@ tag with a @class@ attribute set to its name.

The following table lists the identifiers of all section-like macros, divided according to the part of the book they should be placed in:

	table[
  	tr[
   		th[Frontmatter]
    	td[txt[@imprint@ ^&dagger;^, @dedication@ ^&dagger;^, @inspiration@ ^&dagger;^, @foreword@ ^&Dagger;^, @introduction@ ^&Dagger;^, @acknowledgement@ ^&Dagger;^, @prologue@ ^&Dagger;^, @toc@ ^*^]]
  	]
  	tr[
    	th[Bodymatter]
    	td[txt[@volume@, @book@, @part@, @chapter@]]
  	]
  	tr[
    	th[Backmatter]
    	td[txt[@epilogue@ ^&Dagger;^, @afterword@ ^&Dagger;^, @postscript@ ^&dagger;^, @appendix@, @addendum@ ^&Dagger;^, @glossary@ ^**&Dagger;^, @colophon@ ^&dagger;^, @bibliography@ ^**&Dagger;^, @promotion@ ^&dagger;^, @references@ ^**&Dagger;^, @index@ ^**&Dagger;^, @lot@ ^**&Dagger;^, @lof@ ^**&Dagger;^]]

	p[strong[*]: The %>[toc] is used to generate the Table of Contents automatically, and it takes no parameters.]
	p[strong[**]: This macro is likely to be extended in future versions to generate/aggregate content automatically.]
	p[strong[&dagger;]: This section is not listed in the Table of Contents.]
	p[strong[&Dagger;]: Any subsection of this section is not listed in the Table of Contents.]

	note[
		code[frontmatter], code[bodymatter] and code[backmatter] are also macro identifiers, but they are exposed as attributes for the %>[book] and the %>[article], so if you're using either of these two macros as your root macro for your document, there's no need to use them explicitly.
