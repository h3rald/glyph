If you're authoring a user manual, a long article, or a book, writing everything inside a single @document.glyph@ file may not be optimal. For this reason, Glyph provides an %>[include] that can be used to include the contents of any file within the @text/@ directory:

code[=include[general/introduction.textile]=]

The macro call above loads the contents of the @introduction.textile@ file, within the @text/general@ directory.

When including a text file, an input filter macro is applied to its contents by default, based on the file extension used:
* @.textile@ or @.txt@ &rarr; %>[textile]
* @.markdown@ or @.md@ &rarr; %>[markdown]

You can override this behavior by setting the @filters.by_file_extensions@ configuration setting to @false@. If no extension is specified, @.glyph@ is assumed.

tip[The %>[include] can also be used to include (and evaluate) ruby files (with a @.rb@ extension). In this case, the ruby file must be placed within the @lib/@ directory of the current project.]

While including the context of an entire file is definitely a useful feature for content reuse, sometimes it can be an overkill. What if, for example, you just want to reuse a short procedure or even a sentence or a single word? In this case, you may want to consider using a _snippet_ instead.

Snippets are text strings saved in YAML format in the @snippets.yml@ file. They can be included anywhere in your document using the %>[snippet] (or its alias @&@). 

tip[Besides storing snippets in the @snippets.yml@ file, you can also define them right in your document, using the %>[snippet:].]

	p[You can use code[=&amp;[markups]=] anywhere in your document instead of having to type "\.&[markups]" every time. Additionally, later on you can change the value of the code[markups] snippet only in the code[snippets.yml] file to change it everywhere else in the document.]

	tip[
Snippets (or any other macro) can be nested within other snippets. Glyph takes care of checking if you nested snippets or macros mutually and warns you as necessary.
