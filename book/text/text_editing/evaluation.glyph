&[glang] is not a full-blown programming language and it is currently not Turing-complete (it does not provide loops). However, it is possible to evaluate simple ruby code snippets using the @ruby@ macro (aliased to @%@), like this:
* code[=%[2 + 2]=] &rarr; 4
* code[=%[Time.now]=] &rarr; %[Time.now]
* code[=%[Glyph::VERSION]=] &rarr; %[Glyph::VERSION]

The scope for the code evaluation is the Kernel module, (with all inclusions required by Glyph itself). 

Although it is possible to retrieve Glyph configuration settings in this way (e.g. code[=%[cfg('document.author')]=]), the %>[config] (aliased to @$@) makes things slightly simpler (e.g. code[=$[document.author]=]).
