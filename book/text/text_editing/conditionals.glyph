	txt[
Sometimes you may want text to be included in a document only if certain conditions are satisfied. For example, you may want to display a disclaimer section only if the document is a draft (see the $>[document.draft]), or use a particular stylesheet only if when you generate a PDF document.

To do so, you can use the %>[condition] (aliased by @?@), and a set of additional macros that can be used as conditional operators i.e.:
* %>[eq]
* %>[not]
* %>[and]
* %>[or]
* %>[match]

Consider the following code:
	]
	highlight[=html|
?[$[document.draft]\|
This is a first draft of the Glyph Book]
?[not[$[document.draft]]\|
This is the official version of the Glyph Book]
	=]
	txt[
In this case, if @document.draft@ is set to @true@, "This is a first draft of the Glyph Book" will be displayed; if not, "This is the official version of the Glyph Book" will be displayed instead.

The %>[condition] takes two parameters:
* the first one is the condition to evaluate
* the second one is the text to include in the document only if the condition is satisfied.

Note that _both_ parameters can contain macros, of course, so you can write things like:
	]
	highlight[=html|
?[and[
    eq[$[document.output]\|pdf]
    \|
    eq[$[tools.pdf_generator]\|prince]
    ]
  \|
  style[pagination.css]]
	=]
	p[In this case, the code[pagination.css] stylesheet is included only when you're generating a PDF document using Prince XML.]

The %>[condition] in Glyph works in a similar way as conditionals in programming languages: if the conditional expression (supplied as first parameter) is satisfied then the second parameter is executed or displayed. But when is a conditional expression satisfied? Glyph is a simple mini-language to perform text manipulation, and has no types, it can only understand text, therefore:
* A conditional expression is satisfied if it evaluates to a non-empty string except "false".
* A conditional expression is not satisfied if it evaluates to an empty string or the string "false".
