Lightweight markups let you create internal and external links in a very easy way, and you can still do so in Glyph. However, if you do so:
* you can't check if they are valid
* you can't infer the link title automatically

If you care about link validation and you want to save some keystrokes, then you should use:
* the %>[link] (aliased to @=>@) -- to create internal and external links.
* the %>[anchor] (aliased to @#@) -- to create named anchors (bookmarks) within your document.

		p[&[gcode]]
		highlight[=html|
This is a link to link[#test].
...
This is link[#wrong].
This is a #[test\\\|test anchor].
		=]
		p[&[htmlcode]]
		highlight[=html|
<p>This is a link to <a href="#test">test anchor</a>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This is <a href="#wrong">#wrong</a>.</p>
<p>This is a <a id="test">test anchor</a>.</p>

Basically, if you use the %>[link] and the %>[anchor], Glyph makes sure that:
* all links point to valid anchors within the document (regardless if the anchors are before or after the link, in snippets or included files).
* there are no duplicate anchors within the documents.
* if no title is specified as second parameter for the %>[link], the anchor's name is used as such.

Besides using the %>[anchor], you can also create an anchor for a header by passing an code[@id] attribute the the %>[section], like this: 
	]
	highlight[=html|
section[
  @title[My Section]
  @id[my_section]
...
]
	=]
	note[
At present, link validation and automatic title retrieval only works with internal links (i.e. the check occurs if the first parameter of the %>[link] starts with a code[#]). In the future, the macro could be extended to support external (http) links as well.
